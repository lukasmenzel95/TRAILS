This project analyzes off-road (gravel) cycling terrain using video/photo and GPS data  By classifying surface types (gravel, dirt, asphalt) from ride footage, it maps conditions to specific locations. The system provides post-ride insights to help cyclists choose the best tires for grip and performance based on real riding conditions.
